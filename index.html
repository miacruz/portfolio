                    <p>Course: Design Fundamentals • Spring 2022 • Digital Graphic</p>
                    <p>K-Hall is a graphic depicting a posterized view of what the inside of Kalmanovitz Hall at the University of San Francisco looked like at 2:35 PM during Spring 2022. This design uses complementary colors and tones from those to add to the posterized look and reads “Inside Kalmanovitz Hall / University of San Francisco / at 2:35 PM” at the top. Taking inspiration from the National Parks WPA vintage posterized graphics, this design puts a touristy spin on USF and memorializes what it looked like for students at the time.

                    <p>My Favorite Recipe is a set of two designs that are pages of a cookbook showcasing the artist’s favorite thing to bake, crinkle cookies. The first page is the cover/introduction page, using a full-bleed photo of the finished product and symbols of the Philippine flag’s sun (as this recipe is popular in the Filipino community). The second page is the instructions and ingredients for the recipe. The ingredients and Philippine sun symbols are hand-drawn but all other text on the page is a handwritten style font to compliment the hand drawings. This design evokes a warm, comforting vibe that the artist feels whenever they bake and have this cookie.</p>

                    <p>Calista is a mobile app that is geared towards women and non-binary identifying people who wish to embark on or continue their fitness journey. Created with Justinmind and Thunkable, this app prototype supports features such as forums, interactive maps, logging in/logging out, signing up for an account, editing account settings, and going through and creating reviews. This app prototype was created as a way to bring awareness to women and non-binary people feeling unsafe in the gym setting and also create a sense of community.</p>

                    <p>Marikina is a set of three icons depicting three different iconic symbols to the artist from the city that her dad’s side of the family is from in the Philippines. Each icon is framed by a ring of bamboo, a symbol in Marikina’s city flag. The first icon depicts a pitcher of iced tea, the second one is of “tsinelas”—sandals in Tagalog, and the third icon is of her grandparents’ bus line in the city. This set of icons represents the story of her trip to the Philippines in 2015, but also her grandparents’ impact on the city.</p>
